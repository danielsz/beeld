* Beeld

A tightly focused, delightful library that retrieves metadata from
images and some more. Two namespaces are meant for public consumption,
~beeld.core~ and ~beeld.metadata~.

** Metadata

The most obvious function in the ~beeld.metadata~ is ~tags~, which will
return a data structure (map of maps) with all the metadata available
for the images. Since images can have extensive metadata, the map is
organized around the metadata directories. Think about them as
thematic groupings of information. Examples of such headings are ~Exif
SubIFD~, ~File Type~, ~GPS~, etc.

The argument to ~tags~ are the same arguments that
~clojure.java.io/input-stream~ accepts: InputStream, File, URI, URL,
byte array, String arguments. Likewise, a String argument gets first
resolved as a URI, then as a local file name.

The ~beeld.metadata~ offers convenience functions that retrieve only a
particular metadata tag, for example ~mime-type~, ~lens~, ~make~,
~orientation~, etc.
